# Basys-3-FPGA-calculator

This repository contains a simple calculator implemented on the Basys 3 FPGA development board. The calculator is designed using Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) and is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need a Basys 3 FPGA development board. The following steps will guide you through the process:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Connect your Basys 3 board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Open the project in a Verilog-compatible FPGA development environment, such as Xilinx Vivado.
4. Build and synthesize the project to generate the bitstream file.
5. Program the Basys 3 board with the generated bitstream file.
6. Power on the Basys 3 board and you should be able to use the calculator.

## Usage

Once the calculator is up and running on the Basys 3 board, you can use it to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface is typically implemented using the buttons and switches on the board.
